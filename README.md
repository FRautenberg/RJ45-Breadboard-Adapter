# RJ45-Breadboard Adapter

Transmit 8 channels of signals over long distance

------

## What is  the RJ45-Breadboard Adapter

Supply sensor data to maincontroller

Distribute informations to actuators

Independent from software, microcontroller and their capability

Long range (>15m) and high dataspeed, compared to I2C, SPI, USB, OneWire

Send signals on 8 twisted and shielded cables

Ethernetcables are premade and need no attention

Variable cable lenght via standard RJ45 connector

Compatible with breadboard (2.54mm pin distance)

Green power led (V+) and orange signal led (D1) in the RJ45 connector
